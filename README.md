**This folder consists of the coursework provided in EE551 of Dr. Brian Deegan (University of Galway)**

This repository consists of implementation of various filters, colour transformations, stitching processes, image repair, object detections and so on. 
The repository also consists of DIY filters done using haarcascade and manual coordinate search to fit the filters. All the python code is provided with the images used for the particular code. 
The DIY filters also consists of multi-threading optimization code for better performance in Jetson Nano. 
All the coding is done using python. 
Most of the code consists of manual implmentation of things such as filter implementation, coordinates tagging. 
CV2 is the primarily used library throughout.
